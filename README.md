# Hangman - CPSC 210 Project

## An Overview
**Hangman** is a classic and simple pen and paper game which involves a player to guess a word or phrase only knowing 
the location and amount of letters (and words) that are in said word or phrase.

**Why I Chose  This Project:**
- I've always played these types of pen and paper games, so I thought it would be interesting to flesh out one of these
games into a coding project
- Hangman is a perfect, simple-enough game which fits within my desired scope of difficulty

- As a user, I want to be able to guess a letter
- As a user, I want to be able to see if and where my guessed letter appears in the word
- As a user, I want to be able to see the letters I have already guessed
- As a user, I want to be able to see how many guesses I have remaining
